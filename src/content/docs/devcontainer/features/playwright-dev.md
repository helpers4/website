> Code name: `playwright-dev`

OS-level dependencies for headless Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, a browser-binary cache shared across rebuilds via a Docker named volume, and the official Playwright Test VS Code extension — pre-configured so `npx playwright test` and `npx playwright install` just work, without re-downloading browsers on every rebuild.

## Why this feature exists

Headless browser automation (Playwright, and anything built on Chromium's DevTools Protocol — including `WebAuthn.addVirtualAuthenticator`, useful for testing passkey/WebAuthn flows without physical hardware) needs a real browser binary plus a long list of OS shared libraries. `npx playwright install --with-deps` can fetch both, but:

- it needs `sudo`/root at test-run time to apt-install system packages,
- it re-downloads the browser binaries into `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on every fresh container, since that path isn't normally persisted.

This feature moves both steps into the devcontainer lifecycle: OS packages are installed once at image build time (via the official `playwright install-deps`, not a hand-maintained apt list that would drift across base-image OS versions), and the browser binaries are downloaded once into a named volume that survives rebuilds — the same shape as the `pnpm-store` feature.

It deliberately does **not** install the `playwright` npm package itself — that stays a devDependency of the consuming project, so the CLI version always matches the project's own Playwright version instead of drifting from a separately-installed global one.

### Alternative: Microsoft's prebuilt Playwright image

Microsoft publishes `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v<version>-<os>`, a Docker image with browsers and OS deps already baked in — zero install time, nothing to cache. If you don't need to compose with other `helpers4` features on top of your own base image, using that image directly as `"image"` is simpler than this feature. The tradeoff is that it pins your whole devcontainer to Microsoft's base image and Playwright version, instead of adding browser support to whatever base image and feature set (`typescript-dev`, `vite-plus`, `pnpm-store`, …) you're already using.

## Usage

Add this feature to your `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/playwright-dev:1": {}
    }
}
```

This will:
1. Install the OS packages required to run Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit headless
2. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to a Docker-volume-backed path shared across rebuilds
3. Download the browser binaries into that volume on first container start
4. Install the official Playwright Test VS Code extension, pre-configured

### Chromium only

If your project only needs Chromium (e.g. CDP-based WebAuthn testing), skip the Firefox/WebKit dependencies to keep the image smaller:

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/playwright-dev:1": {
            "browsers": "chromium"
        }
    }
}
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `browsers` | string (`chromium` \| `firefox` \| `webkit` \| `all`) | `all` | Which browser engine(s) to install OS-level dependencies for, and to pre-download into the shared cache. |
| `installDeps` | boolean | `true` | Install the OS packages required to run the selected browser(s) headless, via `playwright install-deps`. Disable if the base image already provides them. |

## IDE support

| Editor | Status | ID |
| ------ | ------ | -- |
| VS Code | ✅ | `ms-playwright.playwright` |
| Cursor | ✅ | `ms-playwright.playwright` (same registry as VS Code) |
| WebStorm / IntelliJ IDEA (2023.3+) | ℹ️ | Playwright tests are recognized natively via the built-in Test Automation plugin — not something this feature installs, nothing to configure here. |
| Zed | 🔜 | no standard devcontainer customization format yet |

## Browser cache volume

Binaries live in a Docker named volume (`helpers4-playwright-browsers-${localEnv:USER}`) mounted at `/usr/local/share/playwright-browsers`, exposed to every shell via `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`. The volume name includes `${localEnv:USER}`, so it's shared across every local devcontainer for the same host OS user — not just rebuilds of one project — the same reasoning as [`pnpm-store`](../pnpm-store): browser binaries are downloaded, versioned artifacts with no credentials attached, so sharing them across your own projects has none of the cross-project bleed risk that keeps an AI tool's credentials volume ([`claude-dev`](../claude-dev), [`mistral-dev`](../mistral-dev)) scoped per devcontainer instead.

A `postCreateCommand` guard script takes ownership of the volume at container creation (with `--shared`, since a second, concurrently-running project can resolve a different container UID) and downloads the browsers only if they haven't been fetched yet for the current Playwright version + `browsers` selection — the version is part of the completion marker specifically because the cache is now shared: two projects pinning different Playwright versions can need different browser revisions, and only the marker (not Playwright's own revision-namespaced cache layout) would otherwise get that wrong.

```bash
# Confirm what's cached
ls "$PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH"
```

## VS Code Extension Included

### Playwright Test for VS Code (ms-playwright.playwright)
- Test explorer: run/debug Playwright tests from the sidebar
- Pick locators, record new tests (codegen), and view traces inline

Settings applied:

```json
{
  "playwright.reuseBrowser": true,
  "playwright.showTrace": true
}
```

## Testing a WebAuthn/passkey flow without hardware

Chromium's DevTools Protocol exposes `WebAuthn.addVirtualAuthenticator` — no extra software authenticator needed. With Playwright:

```ts
const client = await context.newCDPSession(page);
await client.send("WebAuthn.enable");
await client.send("WebAuthn.addVirtualAuthenticator", {
  options: {
    protocol: "ctap2",
    transport: "internal",
    hasResidentKey: true,
    hasUserVerification: true,
    isUserVerified: true,
  },
});
```

## Works Great With

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/playwright-dev:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/typescript-dev:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/vite-plus:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/pnpm-store:1": {}
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Browsers didn't download on first start

The guard script needs network access at `postCreateCommand` time. Re-run it manually, or install directly:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### `install-deps` fails on an unsupported base image

`playwright install-deps` only knows the apt package names for the Debian/Ubuntu versions Playwright officially supports. Pin your base image to one of those, or set `installDeps: false` and install the equivalent packages yourself.

## Version History

- **v1.3.1**: Code-review follow-up on v1.3.0's cache-sharing change — a failed Playwright
  version lookup (offline, transient npx/registry hiccup) fell back to a generic
  `.h4-installed-unknown-*` marker; on the now-shared volume, a *different* project hitting the
  same failure could match that marker and wrongly skip installing a browser revision it
  doesn't actually have. A failed lookup no longer participates in the marker shortcut at all —
  it just re-runs the (idempotent, revision-aware) install for that one start instead.
- **v1.3.0**: The browser-cache volume is now keyed by `${localEnv:USER}` instead of
  `${devcontainerId}` — shared across every local devcontainer for this host OS user instead of
  exclusive to one project, avoiding redundant downloads across your own projects. Safe unlike
  an AI tool's credentials volume: browser binaries carry no identity/permissions surface to
  leak between projects. `h4_ensure_volume_writable` is now called with `--shared`. The download
  completion marker is now also scoped by the resolved Playwright version (previously just the
  `browsers` selection) — necessary now that the cache is shared, since two projects can pin
  different Playwright versions needing different browser revisions; without this, whichever
  project populated the shared cache first would cause a different project's version to wrongly
  skip its own download.
- **v1.2.3**: Internal refactor, no behavior change — the browser-cache ownership logic
  (chown to the current user when needed) now calls `helpers4-common`'s
  `h4_ensure_volume_writable` instead of carrying its own inline copy.
- **v1.2.2**: Documentation only, no functional change — the previous wording sweep made the
  JSON `description` field far too long, shifting focus away from the feature itself onto the
  self-heal side benefit. Shortened to 5 words and kept generic (no implementation detail like
  "git config"), matching the original's brevity and level of detail.
- **v1.2.1**: Documentation only, no functional change — the self-heal callout above (and the
  JSON `description` field) led with internal jargon ("helpers4's self-heal") instead of the
  actual benefit; reworded to lead with what it does, with the full mechanism staying in
  [`helpers4-common`](../helpers4-common)'s own README.
- **v1.2.0**: Documentation only, no functional change — mentions that `helpers4-common`'s
  automatic git-config self-heal (see above) now comes along with this feature.
- **v1.1.0**: Switched from an inline copy of `helpers4-common`'s bootstrap (user detection, apt
  helpers) to a direct `dependsOn` on the `helpers4-common` feature — no behavior change, just a
  single source of truth for that logic instead of a copy every feature had to keep in sync.
- **v1.0.1**: Dropped the `@latest` pin from both `npx playwright` calls — it was forcing the newest registry release instead of the project's own pinned version. Added `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1` to `dependsOn`: `typescript-dev` alone doesn't install Node, so the `npm not found` guard wasn't actually covered. The browser-cache guard now writes a completion marker instead of trusting a non-empty directory, so an interrupted download doesn't get stuck as a permanently broken cache. Added an "IDE support" table and documented the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` prebuilt-image alternative.
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release.
