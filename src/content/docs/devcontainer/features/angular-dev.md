> Code name: `angular-dev`

Angular-specific development environment with VS Code extensions and CLI autocompletion.

> **Also included automatically:** repairs broken host paths in your git config and restores
> your SSH commit-signing key on every attach, on both local and cloud containers, with nothing
> to set up on your end — see [`helpers4-common`](../helpers4-common) for how it works.

## When to use this

Use this feature for an Angular project where you want the curated extension set and CLI
autocompletion set up without picking them one by one. For general TypeScript/JavaScript
tooling that isn't Angular-specific, see [`typescript-dev`](../typescript-dev) instead.

**Alternatives:**
- Angular's own `ng completion` sets up autocompletion too, but you'd need to source it into
  your shell profile yourself on every container — this feature wires it into both zsh and
  bash automatically.
- Hand-picking the 7 extensions below yourself works fine for a one-off project, but drifts
  across projects and needs to be redone whenever you set up a new devcontainer.

## Features

- **VS Code extensions**: Essential Angular development extensions pre-installed
- **CLI autocompletion**: Tab completion for Angular CLI commands in zsh and bash
- **Optional CLI installation**: Install Angular CLI globally if needed

## Usage

Add this feature to your `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/angular-dev:1": {}
    }
}
```

### With Port Forwarding (Recommended)

For the best development experience, add port forwarding for the Angular dev server:

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/angular-dev:1": {}
    },
    "forwardPorts": [4200],
    "portsAttributes": {
        "4200": {
            "label": "Angular Dev Server",
            "onAutoForward": "notify"
        }
    }
}
```

### With Angular CLI installation

If you want to install Angular CLI as part of this feature:

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/angular-dev:1": {
            "installCli": true
        }
    }
}
```

### Recommended setup with Node.js

```json
{
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {
            "version": "20"
        },
        "ghcr.io/helpers4/devcontainer/angular-dev:1": {
            "installCli": true
        }
    },
    "forwardPorts": [4200],
    "portsAttributes": {
        "4200": {
            "label": "Angular Dev Server",
            "onAutoForward": "notify"
        }
    }
}
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `installCli` | boolean | `false` | Install Angular CLI globally |

## VS Code Extensions Included

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `angular.ng-template` | Angular Language Service |
| `johnpapa.angular2` | Angular Snippets |
| `infinity1207.angular2-switcher` | Switch between component files |
| `alexiv.vscode-angular2-files` | Generate Angular files |
| `obenjiro.arrr` | Angular Refactoring Tools |
| `john-crowson.angular-file-changer` | Quick file navigation |
| `cyrilletuzi.angular-schematics` | Angular Schematics integration |

## Port Configuration

The Angular dev server runs on port 4200 by default. Since DevContainer features cannot configure port forwarding directly, you need to add it to your `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
    "forwardPorts": [4200],
    "portsAttributes": {
        "4200": {
            "label": "Angular Dev Server",
            "onAutoForward": "notify"
        }
    }
}
```

| Port | Purpose | Recommended Action |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 4200 | Angular Dev Server | Add to `forwardPorts` in devcontainer.json |

## CLI Autocompletion

Angular CLI autocompletion is automatically configured for both zsh and bash shells. After the container starts, you can use tab completion for:

- `ng <tab>` - Show available commands
- `ng generate <tab>` - Show schematic types
- `ng add <tab>` - Show available packages

## Working with Angular

### Create a new application

```bash
ng new my-app --routing --style=scss
cd my-app
ng serve
```

### Generate components

```bash
ng generate component features/user-profile
ng generate service core/api
ng generate module shared --routing
```

### Build for production

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Angular CLI not found
If `ng` command is not available:
1. Ensure Node.js feature is installed before this feature
2. Set `installCli: true` in the feature options
3. Or install manually: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Autocompletion not working
- Start a new terminal session after container creation
- Ensure you're using zsh or bash shell
- Check that Angular CLI is installed: `which ng`

### Port 4200 not accessible
- Ensure `forwardPorts: [4200]` is in your `devcontainer.json`
- Check if another process is using port 4200
- Verify the dev server is running: `ng serve`
- Check VS Code's Ports panel for forwarding status

## Version History

- **v1.2.3**: Documentation only, no functional change — added a "When to use this" section
  with alternatives, matching the equivalent sections other features in this catalog already had.
- **v1.2.2**: Documentation only, no functional change — the previous wording sweep made the
  JSON `description` field far too long, shifting focus away from the feature itself onto the
  self-heal side benefit. Shortened to 5 words and kept generic (no implementation detail like
  "git config"), matching the original's brevity and level of detail.
- **v1.2.1**: Documentation only, no functional change — the self-heal callout above (and the
  JSON `description` field) led with internal jargon ("helpers4's self-heal") instead of the
  actual benefit; reworded to lead with what it does, with the full mechanism staying in
  [`helpers4-common`](../helpers4-common)'s own README.
- **v1.2.0**: Documentation only, no functional change — mentions that `helpers4-common`'s
  automatic git-config self-heal (see above) now comes along with this feature.
- **v1.1.0**: Switched from an inline copy of `helpers4-common`'s bootstrap (user detection, apt
  helpers) to a direct `dependsOn` on the `helpers4-common` feature — no behavior change, just a
  single source of truth for that logic instead of a copy every feature had to keep in sync.
